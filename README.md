## Features

### Submarines

Submarines are rideable vehicles that operate underwater. Players inside submarines are invulnerable and do not drown. Submarines require fuel to generate power and cannot operate without it.

**Movement Modes:**

Three movement modes are available, each offering different speed and power consumption characteristics. Silent running prioritizes stealth, cruise provides balanced performance, and flank speed maximizes velocity at the cost of higher power consumption and noise.

**Power System:**

Submarines consume power while moving. Power is generated by burning fuel items stored in the submarine inventory. Various fuel types are supported, from basic materials like wood and coal to high-efficiency fuels like lava buckets.

### Torpedoes

Torpedoes are self-propelled underwater projectiles with homing guidance capabilities. They are stored in the submarine inventory and consumed when fired. Multiple targeting modes allow selection of specific entity types to track.

Torpedoes have an arming delay after firing before homing activates. They automatically acquire and track targets within their detection cone. Detonation occurs on impact with blocks or entities, when leaving water, or when reaching maximum range.

### Sonar System

Sonar detects nearby entities and terrain underwater. The system displays contacts on a sweeping line interface. Detected objects include other submarines, players, entities, and underwater terrain. Contacts fade from the display over time.

### Manufacturing Table

A custom crafting station for constructing submarines, torpedoes, and components. The Manufacturing Table provides recipes for all submarine-related items including vehicles, weapons, and specialized parts.

### Repair System

Submarines take damage from explosions and can be repaired using the Submarine Repair Tool. The tool restores health when used on damaged submarines.
