## Overview

**Submarines'n Torpedoes** transforms underwater gameplay with submarine mechanics, torpedo warfare, and sonar detection. Navigate the depths in 3D-modeled submarines, engage in combat, and explore ocean biomes.

## Features

### ⚓ Submarines
Pilot submarines through ocean depths with multiple movement modes - silent running, cruise, or flank speed. Submarines consume fuel to operate and keep passengers safe from drowning and hostile mobs.

### 🚀 Torpedoes
Fire torpedoes that track and destroy targets. Features intelligent homing, multiple targeting modes, arming delay for safety, and long-range strikes.

### 📡 Sonar
Detect threats and terrain with active sonar scanning. The radar display reveals submarines, players, mobs, and obstacles. Each ping consumes power.

### 🔧 Manufacturing Table
Craft submarines, torpedoes, and components at a specialized station.

### 🛠️ Repair System
Maintain submarines with repair tools. Submarines take damage from explosions and require the Submarine Repair Tool for restoration.
